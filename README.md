# RumenCampylobacter2022
This repository is for the analysis code from the Strachan et al. 2022 paper "Differential partitioning of key carbon substrates at the rumen wall by recently diverged Campylobacteraceae populations"

## Bioinformatic processing
The code used to process sequence data to various output tables (ex. count tables) is found in the folder 'Processing'. This is where the command line settings for various bioinformatic tools can be found. Most time, commands are run within pipelines that are written in python.

## Statistical analysis and figure generation
The code for the analysis of the various output tables can be found in the folder 'Figures'. The analysis is organized by the figures in Strachan et al. 2020 that it was used to generate.

## Analysis not included in this repository
There are a a subset of analysis and plots (ex. alignments and trees) that were implemented in the software Geneious (https://www.geneious.com/). This is described in the Materials and Methods of the paper.
